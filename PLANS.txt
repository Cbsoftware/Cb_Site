Cb_Site Plans
=============

Goal:
----
A lightweight CMS specially constructed to handle Cb's needs, and expanded when necessary. Much of the structural ideas here are based on WordPress and Pods for WordPress.


Functional Needs:
----------------
new 	- make new things
edit	- edit existing things
upload	- upload media
delete	- delete anything by id


Taxonomies:
----------
Numerous "taxonomies" or "post-types" will be needed to display the appropriate template for given content. Currently those taxonomies are:

	software	- publicly released software
		history	- version history
	news		- announcements and news relevant to Cb
	blog		- anything, really
		category- content sorting category
	status		- updates forwarded to Twitter, attributed to the author (130 chars.)
	press		- links to any articles, mentions, interviews related to Cb
	experiment	- reports for scientific experiments conducted by Cb
	page		- page on the site, including archive pages for other taxonomies
	media		- sub-tax common to software, news, blog, experiment, and page
	user		- user profile

Each of these taxonomies has its own set of necessary and optional values. The one common value is the id. Following is a break down of the taxonomies and their values. Value are considered necessary unless marked otherwise:

u - represents a unique value
a - represents an automatically filled value
o - represents an optional value
b - represents a boolean value
s - represents a sub-taxonomy

	software

		license	- o - license under which the software is released and optional url separated by a comma
		repo	- o - url of the software's repository

	forum		- can contain other forums, as well as posts
		for_post- forum post
	ticket		- issue-tracking ticket


Templating and Template Tags:
-------------------------
Templates are applied using a specific to generic naming hierarchy, looking for [slug].html before [taxonomy].html. For example, if we have a page with the slug "about", the template system first looks for "about.html". If that's not found, it looks for "page.html".

Template tags are used to display information contained in the post objects. For example, the title of a news post, for which the tag might look like:
	<#title>

Template tags will also be used to call sub-taxonomy lists or archives into the template, as well as define an optional template to use to display those sub-taxonomies. For example, on a software page there'll be a history sub-tax. A template tag for this might look like:
	<#tax="history">
	
This would display all the history posts associated with this post and display them using the history template.	If we'd like to list the five latest news posts with a special template, the template tag might look like:
	<#tax="news" limit="5" template="front-news">


Alternate posting systems:
-------------------------
The primary method of posting content to the site will be through the site's admin panel. For simpler posts, namely status posts and perhaps blog posts, a few faster methods may be appropriate.

	Posting inline - Posting directly on the site, if logged in. A link would be made available somewhere near the latest posts allowing you to immediately add and publish a post to the site.

	Command line - posting from the command line, using a simple command. Status posts would be one line with only one value to fill, e.g.:
		cb new status "I'm making up a whole new CMS RIGHT NOW!"

		Blog posts would be a bit more complicated, e.g.:
		cb new blog title="This is the Title", content="This is a blog post. It's not too long, nor very complicated, but it's more elaborate than status update, and likely more valuable information-wise."
